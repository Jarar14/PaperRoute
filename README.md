# Paper Route

Allows user to quickly read most popular news articles from the past 24 hours

## Project goals
Implementing options to allow the user to read the most popular news from the past 1 day, 2 days, 4 days and 7 days. Popularity is ranked by article activity (no. of comments/views). We also intend to implement a function that updates the user on the top news since they last used the app, by recording their last date of use, gathering top news from every day since then, and compiling the most popular articles for the user.

## Built With


* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Main language
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Web framework
* [HTML/CSS/JS] - Web design
