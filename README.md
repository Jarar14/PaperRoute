# Paper Route
Allows user to quickly catch up on the popular news articles using a compiled news list. We can filter news by the past 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days and 4 days and 1 week, with separate categories such as Business and Sport

## Project Goals
Implementing options to allow the user to read the most popular news from various times, with a focus on news better suited to user geolocation and interests. Article popularity is ranked by article activity. We also intend to implement a function that updates the user on the top news since they last used the app, by recording their last date of use, gathering top news from every day since then, and compiling the most popular articles for the user.
